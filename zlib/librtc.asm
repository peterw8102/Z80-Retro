; Real Time Clock (RTC) driver
; The RTC chip (DS1307+) is connected to the I2C bus. As wells as providing a clock the chip
; also contains 56 bytes of non-volatile memory.
;
; DS1307+ Datasheet: https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/256/DS1307-1513036.pdf
;
; Exports:
; RTC_INI:  Initialise the RTC interface. Call before first use. Currently just initialises I2C
; RTC_SOS:  Start the RTC oscilator at 1KHz
; RTC_GET:  Return the 7 byte encoded date/time from the DS1307+ chip
; RTC_SET:  Write the 7 byte date/time format to the DS1307+. See datasheet for format details
; RTC_MRD:  Read some/all of the NVRAM bytes from the DS1307+, skipping the clock bytes
; RTC_MWR:  Write to the NVRAM with protection from accidentally overwritting clock control byte
; RTC_CL:   Clear all 56 NVRAM bytes
