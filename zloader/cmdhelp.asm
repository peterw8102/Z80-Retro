; ----- HELP
; Display mode specific help text. The first byte of each entry is a bitmap
; of the modes in which this command entry is recognised. The bits in this
; byte are compared against the current OPMODE for a match and skipped if
; not applicable. The flag is followed by two strings, each terminated by
; a character with the MSB set. The first is the command syntax, the
; second is a summary description.
